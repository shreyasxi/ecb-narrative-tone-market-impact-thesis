## 📌 Overview

The objective of this thesis is to quantify how the tone of European Central Bank communications influences euro-area markets across policy statements, press conferences, Monetary Policy Accounts, and Executive Board speeches.

It primarily constitues: 
- **Channel-specific tone & Comparison:** Using ECB-specific lexicons to build sentence-level hawk–dove scores and assess whether tone adds incremental information beyond policy news across all channels.
- **Event timing & high-frequency identification:** Intraday reactions are measured in tightly defined windows taken from the EA-MPD and EA-CED datasets to precisely time announcements, use high-frequency returns to isolate immediate market moves, and extract policy-news factors via PCA.
- **Isolating pure tone effects:** Separate narrative tone from contemporaneous policy surprises (Target/FG/QE) to recover the tone-only impact.
- **Daily persistence:** Building on intraday analysis using EA-MPD and EA-CED, I re-estimate on daily changes to test whether tone effects persist beyond the announcement window and survive broader market noise.
- **State dependence:** Interact tone with the ECB CISS to gauge how tone’s impact varies with financial stress.
- **Robustness & reproducibility:** Verify results with alternative tone dictionaries, orthogonalized (“policy-free”) tone, and subsample analysis (pre/post-COVID).

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Intraday drivers</strong></td>
      <td>Policy surprises dominate high-frequency reactions; tone effects are generally small and statistically weak.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Q&amp;A equities</strong></td>
      <td>During the press-conference Q&amp;A, equities show a modest positive response to tone; interest rates do not co-move with tone in this window.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Daily persistence</strong></td>
      <td>By the daily close, most tone effects attenuate or vanish; daily variation is largely absorbed by broad risk and idiosyncratic factors.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Accounts × CISS</strong></td>
      <td>In Monetary Policy Accounts, tone is positive at average stress but its impact dampens as systemic stress (CISS) rises.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Term-structure pattern</strong></td>
      <td>Loadings align with theoretical intuition: <strong>Target → short rates</strong>, <strong>Forward-Guidance → belly</strong>, <strong>QE → long end &amp; spreads</strong>; equity/FX effects are smaller and more heterogeneous.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Bottom line</strong></td>
      <td>Narrative tone matters in specific contexts, but hard policy signals carry most of the market moves.</td>

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Financial Datasets/` — Curated market and rates datasets required to run the analysis (CSV/XLSX).
- `Research Paper/` — Final paper (**Dissertation.pdf**) and LaTeX source (`dissertation.tex`).
- `results/` — Exported tables, figures, and regression outputs generated by the notebook.
- `Dissertation.ipynb` — Core analysis notebook with fully reproducible code (tables, figures, regressions).
- `all_ECB_speeches.csv` — ECB communications dataset (speeches only); other channels were web-scraped directly from the ECB website.

## 🔧 Replication guide

### Requirements
- Python **3.10+**
- Jupyter (or VS Code with the **Python** + **Jupyter** extensions)
- Key Packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `nltk`, `regex`, `unidecode`

### Setup
1. **Clone or download** the repo. Keep the folder structure **unchanged** (the notebook expects relative paths like `Financial Datasets/...`, `all_ECB_speeches.csv`, etc).
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shreyasxi/ecb-narrative-tone-market-impact-thesis.git
   cd ecb-narrative-tone-market-impact-thesis

2. Open `Dissertation.ipynb` (in **Jupyter** or **VS Code**).

3. **Run All** (VS Code: `Run ▸ Run All`) to:
   - load the **ECB text + tone** data,
   - build the **daily asset panels** and **controls**,
   - estimate **baseline** and **CISS-interaction** regressions,

**Outputs:** regression summaries, coefficient tables, and figures in `results/` (also referenced in the paper).
