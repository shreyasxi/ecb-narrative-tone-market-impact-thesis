## Abstract
This thesis studies whether, and through which communication channels, the European Central Bank’s (ECB) **narrative tone** affects **daily euro-area financial markets**. Tone is measured with ECB-adapted hawk–dove dictionaries at the sentence level and standardized within channel. We compare press releases, press-conference Q&A, monetary policy accounts, and Executive Board speeches. Using stacked daily panels with asset and time fixed effects and two-way clustered standard errors, we test for **cross-channel heterogeneity** and **state dependence** via the ECB Composite Indicator of Systemic Stress (CISS).

## Key findings (at a glance)
- **Channel heterogeneity:** Tone in policy statements and accounts has stronger and more consistent effects than speeches; Q&A can amplify effects.  
- **Asset sensitivity:** Short-rate proxies and sovereign spreads respond more than broad equity/FX in daily data.  
- **State dependence:** Effects are **larger under high financial stress** (CISS interactions).  
- **Interpretation:** Narrative tone contains incremental information beyond standard policy-news factors at the daily horizon.
